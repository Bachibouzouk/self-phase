## Code for simulation to be translated from matlab -> julia
Done by Rigel and Joseph as part of undergraduate thesis.

Parallel branch for running the simulation over a range of input parameters
## Todo
* ~~Translate Main Loop~~
* ~~Translate "PPT.m"~~
* ~~Turn chunks of main loop into functions~~
* Optimize
* Test
* ~~Use plan fft/ifft to speed up all the transforms~~
